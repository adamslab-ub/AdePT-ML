Welcome to HyPyML's documentation!
==================================

This is a convienience library built on top of PyTorch to enable easy integration and training of hybrid models involving physics and deep learning modules. 

### Features
1. Pre-defined Modules and configs for physics and MLP architectures.
2. Physics Module accepts numpy arrays as outputs.
3. Ability to input custom PyTorch nn classes
4. Ensemble Module allows easy integration of constituent physics and ML modules for simple inference and training.
5. Auto log training data with tensorboard.
